Save to Website
==============================

### Overview

An extension for Google Chrome which adds a "save to website" option 
to the menu when you right click on images on web pages.

### Requirements

Along with this extension you'll also need your own webserver and 
enough nerd points to be able to save and configure a php script that
this extension interfaces with. Its super simple, but you'd better
know where your web accessable paths are n shit.

### Credits n Props

This extension is a stripped down hack of antimatter15's cloudsave:

Props to the crazy88 for putting up with my testing.

### Version Info

17/03/2011 
* v 0.0.1

I'm porting the hardcoded version of this into an easily configurable
version which anyone would be able to setup and use on their own web
server.
