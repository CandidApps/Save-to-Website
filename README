Save to Website
==============================

### Overview

An extension for Google Chrome which adds a "save to website" option 
to the menu when you right click on images on web pages.

### Requirements

Along with this extension you'll also need your own webserver and 
enough nerd points to be able to save and configure a php script that
this extension interfaces with. Its super simple, but you'd better
know where your web accessable paths are.

### Installation

Firstly, create a world writable directory on your webserver 
(ie: chmod 777 it). Create subfolders below this if you want to enable
saving into a few different groups.

You will need to save a copy of, and configure, the Save-to-Website.php 
file to somewhere world readable on your webserver.
